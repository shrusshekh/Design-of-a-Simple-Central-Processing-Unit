ENTITY latch2 IS
	PORT(A: IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- 8 bit A input
		  Resetn, Clock: IN STD_LOGIC; -- 1 bit clock input and 1 bit reset input bit
		  Q: OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0)); -- 8 bit output
END latch2;

ARCHITECTURE Behavior of latch2 IS
BEGIN
	PROCESS (Resetn, Clock) -- process takes reset and clock as inputs
	BEGIN 
		IF Resetn = '1' THEN -- when reset input is 1 the latches do not operate 
			Q <= "00000000";
		ELSIF Clock'EVENT AND Clock = '1' THEN -- level sensitive based on clock
			Q <= A;
		END IF; 
	END PROCESS;
END Behavior;
